# Project

Term CMPS-4910

For our project, we propose the development of a pop-up verification, such as a puzzle or entering a code of numbers that, upon completion of the verification, the alarm would then turn off. By including a widget of a verification puzzle or number entering login for the user to complete, it would allow the individual to be fully conscious by the time they shut off their alarm and they can carry on with their daily schedule on time.

Objective
o To provide a simple application verification that is intended to reduce unanswered alarms from ringing.
o To ensure the user is conscious by the time they turn off their alarm.
o Reduce the need for multiple alarms.
o Provide a primary promote-specific pop-up verification, for the individual to complete, to turn off their set alarm.
